###  NYC Payroll Data Integration Capstone Project
Welcome to the NYC Payroll Data Integration project! This repository contains the code, documentation, and other resources related to my capstone project for integrating and analyzing payroll data across New York City agencies.

Project Overview
The City of New York is undertaking a project to integrate payroll data from various city agencies. The main objectives of this project are to:

Financial Resource Allocation Analysis: Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated, focusing on overtime pay.
Transparency and Public Accessibility: Make payroll data accessible to the public to demonstrate how the Cityâ€™s budget is spent on salaries and overtime.
As a Data Engineer, I am responsible for designing a data warehouse, developing a scalable and automated ETL pipeline, ensuring data quality, and making the data available for public access.

Tools and Technologies
To accomplish the project objectives, I am utilizing the following tools and technologies:

Python: For scripting and automation.
Apache Airflow: For orchestrating the ETL pipeline.
AWS Redshift: For setting up the data warehouse.
SQL: For data querying and aggregation.
Git & GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data/: Contains raw and processed data files.
scripts/: Contains ETL scripts used to process and load data into the warehouse.
images/: Includes diagrams, such as the dimensional model and data architecture.
docs/: Contains additional documentation related to the project.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and prototyping.
